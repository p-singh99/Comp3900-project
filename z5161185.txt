Week 1
The group was formed on Thursday. The same day we formulated some preliminary user stories. All team members participated.

Week 2
On wednesday following the lecture we set up the Jira & github pages. The user stories from week 1 were added and acceptance criteria were specified for each.

Week 3
User stories were revised and all acceptance criteria were added. We worked on the various diagrams. I contributed to the storyboard and ER Diagram mostly. We used scrum poker to determine user story points. I added references to and finalised the background section of the proposal. The first sprint was created. Finally the proposal was submitted.

Week 4
Work was started on the first sprint. I was tasked with creating the database functionality for the first sprint. I created a remotely hosted postgres database so any team member can easily access the same database. I created a preliminary schema for the database and added some test data so the api and front end would have something to work with for testing.

Week 5
I continued working on the database. I improved the sql schema and added a python script that populates and depopulates the database with test data, based on real podcast rss feeds.
