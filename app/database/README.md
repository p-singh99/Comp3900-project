### Functions
#### match\_category\_and\_podcast(\_podcast text, \_category text)
This function is intended to be used to easily insert tuples into the podcastCategories table. For instance, ```insert into podcastCategories select * from match_category_and_podcast('podcast', 'category');``` would insert a tuple with the id of the podcast named 'podcast' and the id of a category named 'category'.

**Returns**: A query that contains a podcastId associated with the podcast name and a categoryId associated with the category name. If either don't exist, nothing is returned.  
**Usage**: ```select * from match_category_and_podcast('podcast name', 'category name');```
**Return example**:
```
podcastId  |  categoryId 
-----------+------------
     5     |     3
```

#### match\_category\_and\_parent(\_category text, \_parent text)

The new id for the category is also automatically generated in the function.
