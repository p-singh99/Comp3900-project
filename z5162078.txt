Week 1
The group was formed on Thursday. We then held a meeting at around 6 and made an initial set of user stories that covered all the base requirements of the 
project (UltraCast). We then also scheduled a meeting to take place on the night after the lecture.

Week 2
After watching the lectures we got into a meeting together and then transferred all of the user stories into Jira and made acceptance criteria which we all
collaborated upon.
