Week 1
The group was formed on Thursday. We then held a meeting at around 6 and made an initial set of user stories that covered all the base requirements of the 
project (UltraCast). We then also scheduled a meeting to take place on the night after the lecture.

Week 2
After watching the lectures we got into a meeting together and then transferred all of the user stories into Jira and made acceptance criteria which we all
collaborated upon.

Week 3
We had a meeting on Monday to discuss where we are with the project proposal. After that we started on the storyboarding. I had to leave mid-way urgently but
came back at the end to discuss our next meeting and and what our plans are.
We met again during our tutorial slot where we again discussed what aspects of the project proposal we are still missing and assigned people to complete them.
I made a start on an ER diagram and a UML diagram. That night we went through all of our user stories and did scrum poker to assign story points.
On Friday, we met again to finally grab all the diagrams and documents and then I went on putting them all together and into the project proposal. I wrote up
all the user stories in a readable format for the proposal and also answered things like how the user stories answered the project objectives and any novelty
functions we had in the user stories.
We met up on final time on Saturday to confirm everything on the proposal
I submitted the documents after some edits from the team members submitted on Sunday morning and afternoon.

Week 4
I started work on the searching functionss and algorithms.

Week 5
I helped connect the Searching from the front end to the back end and helped making the search page results
