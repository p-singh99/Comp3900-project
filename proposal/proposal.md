## Background

Listening to podcasts is popular with many people. We aim to make listening to podcasts easier for people who wish to use their desktop or laptop computers for listening to podcasts.  
Many solutions for listening to podcasts exist, notably Spotify, Pocketcasts, the ABC Listen App, Google Podcasts, and Soundcloud. Each of these have a number of strength as well as drawbacks.

### Spotify
Spotify is available primarily as a phone app, as well as a desktop applications, and a web app. It requires users sign up to the app, and offers podcasts as a secondary feature to its core use; music.  

#### Drawbacks

* Spotify requires users to sign up
* Spotify plays ads to non-premium users (users who do not pay for the service) // todo: do they play ads through the podcast?
* Being primarily aimed at music listeners, spotify provides a sub optimal experience for reccomending podcasts to users
* Spotify does not support show notes


### Pocketcasts
Pocketcasts is primarily a phone app that is dedicated to podcasts.

#### Drawbacks

* Pocketcasts requires users to sign up before they can access the platform
* Pocketcasts restricts use of their web app to paying customers

### ABC Listen App
The ABC Listen App is a mobile app that allows users to listen to ABC produced radio shows and podcasts.

#### Drawbacks

* The ABC Listen app only provides access to ABC radio programs and podcasts

### Google Podcasts

Google Podcasts is a web app (//todo: and mobile app?)

#### Drawbacks

* The Google web app requires users to sign up before they can access the platform
* Google Podcasts does not allow access to the show notes of each episode

### Soundcloud

#### Drawbacks

* Soundcloud has very spotty coverage of podcast apps, seemingly by users uploading their favourite episodes
